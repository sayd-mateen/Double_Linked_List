# Double_Linked_List

In this program I implemented a sorted list with the doubly linked technique using these methods.
a. insert(double n) – Insert double precision number n into the sorted list.
b. listAscending() – List all numbers of the list in ascending order.
c. listDescending() – List all numbers of the list in descending order.
